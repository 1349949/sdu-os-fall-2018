# SDU OS Fall 2018

This is the official repository of Operating System course of Taishan College. This repoistory is mainly served these purposes:

* Report submission
* Progress logging

**Please don't put your source code directly here.**

## Submission Guide

You need fork this repoistory and [keep it up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). To submit files, you should first commit your files to your fork then create a pull request.

### How to Submit Work Progress

Create a markdown file in `progress` folder. For the sake of anonymity, **the filename should be same as your GitHub ID**. You **must** append your work progress **weekly** since National Holiday **until the final presentation**. Your submission will influence your final grade.

### How to Submit Your Final Work

In the end of this course, you must submit your final work (source code and result generated by your code).

Don't put your final work in this repoistory directly. Instead, you are expected to create your own repository, then clone it into the `code` folder, [making it a submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v1/Git-%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7-%E5%AD%90%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97).
